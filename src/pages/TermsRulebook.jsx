      <p>
        Impakrintas reserves the right to determine, in its sole discretion, whether a user has violated

      <p>
        These terms outline the general pre-requisites for NPOs seeking to list projects on the

      <p>
        Impakrintas performs rigorous verification of legal status, financial statements (minimum spending/funding requirements), operational history, and "fit
        and proper" checks on all directors and key personnel. We reserve the right to request
        additional documentation or conduct background checks at any time.
      </p>

      <h4>3.4 RC Approval:</h4>
      <p>
        Listing is subject to the final approval or rejection of the Management Review Committee (RC) of Impakrintas.
      </p>

      <h3>4. Project Listing and Obligations</h3>

      <h4>4.1 Accurate Disclosure:</h4>
      <p>
        NPOs warrant that all information provided for project listings (goals, budget, timeline, use of funds) is accurate, complete, and not misleading.
      </p>

      <h4>4.2 Ongoing Compliance and Monitoring:</h4>
      <p>
        NPOs agree to ongoing monitoring by Impakrintas. You must immediately notify Impakrintas if your legal or tax status changes,
        lapses, or is revoked.
      </p>

      <h4>4.3 Project Delays and Reporting:</h4>
      <p>
        If a project faces roadblocks or delays that push the completion date beyond the declared timeline, the NPO must proactively inform Impakrintas
        and all donors, providing revised timelines and justifications for RC approval.
      </p>

      <h4>4.4 Fraudulent Activity:</h4>
      <p>
        Any proven fraudulent activity will result in immediate delisting, permanent banning from the platform, notification to the SC and PDRM, and potential legal
        action.
      </p>

      <h3>5. Fees and Payment Terms</h3>

      <h4>5.1 Platform Fees:</h4>
      <p>
        NPOs agree to pay Impakrintas agreed-upon platform fees of 8% based on funds raised through the platform.
      </p>

      <h4>5.2 Timely Payment:</h4>
      <p>
        Fees must be paid in a timely manner (e.g., within 14 days of invoice). Failure to pay fees may result in the suspension of the NPO's ability to list new projects or
        access future features.
      </p>

      <h2>PART C: TERMS APPLICABLE to DONORS</h2>
      <p>
        These terms outline the rights, responsibilities, and risks associated with donating through the
        Impakrintas platform.
      </p>

      <h3>6. Donations and Transactions</h3>

      <h4>6.1 Minimum Donation:</h4>
      <p>
        A minimum donation amount of Ringgit Malaysia Five (RM5.00) applies to all projects.
      </p>

      <h4>6.2 Direct Pass-Through Model:</h4>
      <p>
        Impakrintas uses a direct pass-through payment model via a local service provider. Your donation goes directly from your account to the NPO's verified
        bank account. Impakrintas does not hold your donation funds in custody.
      </p>

      <h4>6.3 Finality of Donations:</h4>
      <p>
        All donations are final once processed. As Impakrintas does not hold funds, donors must deal directly with the NPO for any refund. Donors should exercise due
        diligence before contributing.
      </p>

      <h4>6.4 Tax Deductions:</h4>
      <p>
        Donors may be eligible for tax deductions under Malaysian law. Impakrintas ensures all listed NPOs have active LHDN Section 44(6) status and provides digital
        receipts accordingly. Eligibility for tax deductions is the donor's responsibility to confirm with
        LHDN.
      </p>

      <h3>7. Donor Risks and Disclaimers</h3>

      <h4>7.1 Project Outcomes:</h4>
      <p>
        Donations are made to support NPO projects, not investments. There is no expectation of financial return. Impakrintas rigorously vets NPOs but cannot guarantee the
        full success of every social impact project.
      </p>

      <h4>7.2 Underfunded Projects:</h4>
      <p>
        In the event a project does not meet its fundraising goal, funds will be managed according to the specific terms disclosed on that project's page (e.g., used for
        a scaled-down project or potentially refunded), depending on the NPO approved terms.
      </p>

      <h4>7.3 Non-Compliance:</h4>
      <p>
        While Impakrintas actively monitors compliance, events outside our control (e.g., a sudden revocation of tax status) may occur. Donors will be notified of material
        adverse changes, but remediation of funds may be subject to legal processes involving
        Malaysian authorities.
      </p>

      <h2>PART D: MISCELLANEOUS</h2>

      <h3>8. Limitation of Liability</h3>
      <p>
        To the maximum extent permitted by Malaysian law, Impakrintas shall not be liable for any
        indirect, incidental, special, consequential, or punitive damages, or any loss of profits or
        revenues, whether incurred directly or indirectly, or any loss of data, use, goodwill, or other
        intangible losses, resulting from (a) your access to or use of or inability to access or use the
        platform; (b) any conduct or content of any third party on the platform, including without
        limitation, any fraudulent NPO activity; or (c) unauthorized access, use, or alteration of your
        transmissions or content.
      </p>

      <h3>9. Governing Law and Dispute Resolution</h3>
      <p>
        These Terms shall be governed by the laws of Malaysia. Any disputes arising out of or in
        connection with these Terms shall be subject to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts of
        Malaysia.
      </p>

      <h3>10. Modifications to Terms</h3>
      <p>
        Impakrintas reserves the right to revise these Terms of Use at any time. We will provide notice
        of material changes by posting the updated terms on our platform. Continued use after such
        changes constitutes acceptance of the new Terms.
