      <h1>About Us</h1>

      <p className="lead">At its core, social impact begins with trust.</p>

      <p>
        In Malaysia’s growing social finance landscape, donors increasingly want more than just
        the ability to give — they want confidence that their contributions are directed to the
        right causes, used as intended, and backed by clear reporting on progress and results.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Social Exchange, a key initiative under Securities Commission Malaysia (SC) new
        Capital Market Masterplan 2026-2030 (CMP) is designed to meet this need while
        simultaneously broadening access and market participation to social impact financing.
        It will redefine how social impact initiatives and funding are carried out - through
        transparency, accountability and structured regulatory framework.
      </p>

      <p>
        LC Wakaful Digital Sdn Bhd (LCWD) is Malaysia’s first regulated Social Exchange Platform
        operator appointed by SC. As a wholly-owned subsidiary of Gobarakah Tech Sdn Bhd
        (owner operator of Gobarakah Smart Giving Fintech, a multiple award-winning fintech
        company), LCWD develops and operates Impakrintas, a platform designed to combine
        regulated fundraising (cash donations) for eligible social impact projects, with constant
        community support, transparency and governance.
      </p>

      <p>
        As the operator, LCWD is registered under section 76A of the Capital Markets and Services
        Act 2007 (CMSA). It is primarily responsible for onboarding, listing and monitoring eligible
        Non-Profit Organization (NPO) social impact projects for fundraising in accordance with the
        requirements set out in the Guidelines.
      </p>

      <h2>Impakrintas - A pioneer in regulated social impact fundraising</h2>

      <p>
        Impakrintas was created with the simple belief that when donors can see how funds are used
        and what progress is being made, giving becomes stronger and more sustainable.
      </p>

      <h3>On Impakrintas:</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Donations are made to approved projects by eligible NPOs.</li>
        <li>
          The platform is structured to support clear project information, disclosures, and
          reporting, so donors can follow social updates, fund utilisation, and social impact
          outcomes easily.
        </li>
        <li>
          NPOs participating in Impakrintas for project listing for the purposes of fundraising enjoy
          tax parity under subsection 44(6) and paragraph 13(1) of Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act
          1967. Currently Impakrintas is the only platform with this status. This enables both
          eligible NPOs raising funds and donors supporting the listed projects.
        </li>
      </ul>
