      <h2>How does Impakrintas ensure transparency in donations?</h2>
      <p>
        Transparency and good governance in managing social impact projects are the core principles of Impakrintas.
        We’re built to help donors understand what they’re funding, where the money goes, and how project progress is
        reported.
      </p>
      <p>In practice, the platform supports transparency through:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Clear, standardised project information:</strong> Every approved project must explain its objective,
          who it helps, where it will be carried out, how long it will run, the fundraising target, and a clear budget—
          so donors can make an informed decision.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Direct fund flow to the NPO:</strong> Donations made through Impakrintas are credited directly into the
          NPO’s designated bank account for the project. Impakrintas does not hold donated funds. This ensures
          compliance with tax laws of Malaysia with regards to donations made to NPOs with approved subsection 44(6) and
          paragraph 13(1) of Schedule 6 of the Income Tax Act 1967 status.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Structured disclosure and reporting:</strong> NPOs are expected to publish ongoing information such as:
          <ul>
            <li>Project updates and progress - what’s being delivered, milestones, changes</li>
            <li>Quarterly fund utilisation reporting - how donations were spent against the budget, with supporting proof where required</li>
            <li>Impact/outcomes reporting - what the project achieved against stated indicators</li>
            <li>
              Annual audited financial statements (project-level) and annual project impact reporting for ongoing projects (where applicable)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Disclosure of off-platform donations for the listed project:</strong> If an NPO raises funds for the
          same project through other channels, they are expected to declare those external donations so donors can see
          the fuller fundraising picture for the purposes of reporting on fund utilization and social impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Platform review and audit trails:</strong> Compulsory submissions like expense reporting and major
          disclosures on project delays or roadblocks go through platform processes and review before being displayed,
          and donation records and disclosures are maintained to support accountability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Overall, donors should be able to see what was promised, what funds were used for, and what was delivered, in a
        way that’s timely and easy to follow.
      </p>

      <h2>How are social impact projects approved?</h2>
      <p>
        Only eligible NPOs can raise funds on Impakrintas, and every project goes through a structured review, approval
        and onboarding process before it can be listed.
      </p>
      <p>In general, approval includes these steps:</p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <strong>NPO eligibility screening (organisation-level)</strong>
          <p>
            We first confirm the organisation meets baseline requirements (e.g., recognised legal form in Malaysia,
            relevant tax status, operating track record, governance and basic capacity).
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Governance and integrity checks</strong>
          <p>
            Key individuals such as directors, controllers and key personnel are assessed through required ‘fit and
            proper’ and conflict of interest declarations, with risk-based checks to protect fundraising integrity.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Project assessment</strong>
          <p>The NPO submits a project plan that is reviewed for:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>social impact objective and public benefit</li>
            <li>clear scope, beneficiary types, location, duration, and milestones</li>
            <li>budget and intended use of donations, including operating and direct project costs</li>
            <li>feasibility and delivery capacity</li>
            <li>reporting such as fund utilisation and impact/progress updates</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Compliance and risk review</strong>
          <p>
            The project and fundraising setup is checked against Guidelines and Rulebooks and applicable requirements,
            including AML/CFT checks and disclosures such as off-platform fundraising.
          </p>
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Internal approval and listing readiness</strong>
          <p>
            Projects are approved through the platform’s internal review and governance processes. Before project
            listing, the NPOs have to be officially approved by the Impakrintas Management Review Committee (IMRC) with a
            Project Brief produced as a result of the approval. Next, the NPO has to complete required administrative
            steps such as signing of a Listing Agreement, bank account verification and onboarding and NPO admin access
            to Impakrintas.
          </p>
        </li>
      </ol>
