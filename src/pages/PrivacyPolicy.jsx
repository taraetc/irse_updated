      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>To Facilitate Donations (Pass-Through Model):</strong> To

        <li>
          <strong>With NPOs (for Donors):</strong> We share necessary donor

          appropriate documentation for tax purposes.
        </li>
        <li>

        for which it was collected, comply with our legal and regulatory
        obligations (e.g., maintaining audit trails for the SC), and resolve
        disputes. Due diligence records for NPOs and transaction logs are
        maintained for a period mandated by Malaysian securities laws and
        Guidelines on Social Exchange Platforms.
      </p>

      <h2>5. Data Security</h2>

        We implement robust security measures, as detailed in our internal
        Technology Risk Policy, to protect your personal data from unauthorized
        access, loss, misuse, or alteration. These measures include encryption,
        access controls, and secure data storage practices that align with
